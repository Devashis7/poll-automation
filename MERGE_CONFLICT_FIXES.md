# Merge Conflict Issues and Fixes

## Overview

After resolving merge conflicts, several configuration and implementation issues were identified and fixed to ensure the poll automation system functions correctly.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Environment Variables ❌ → ✅

**Problem**: The backend `.env` file was missing critical email configuration variables required for user authentication features (registration welcome emails, password reset emails, and student invitations).

**Fixed**: Added the following environment variables to `apps/backend/.env`:

```env
# Email Configuration (for development - uses Gmail SMTP)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
SENDER_EMAIL=your_gmail_email@gmail.com

# Frontend URL for password reset links
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Note**: Users need to replace the placeholder email values with actual Gmail credentials and app password.

### 2. User Profile Update Logic Issue ❌ → ✅

**Problem**: The `updateProfile` function in `user.controller.ts` had inconsistent handling of `firstName`, `lastName`, and `fullName` fields, causing potential crashes when updating user profiles.

**Fixed**:

- Improved the `updateProfile` function to handle both individual name fields and full name
- Added proper validation and fallback logic
- Ensured consistency between different name representations

### 3. Missing Avatar Upload Route ❌ → ✅

**Problem**: The frontend was trying to upload avatars to `/api/users/avatar`, but this route was not properly configured in the backend.

**Fixed**:

- Added multer configuration for file uploads
- Implemented proper avatar upload route with file validation
- Created the `uploads/avatars` directory
- Added file size limits (5MB) and type validation (images only)

### 4. Route Configuration Issues ❌ → ✅

**Problem**: Some routes were imported but not properly configured.

**Fixed**:

- Ensured all authentication routes are properly mapped
- Verified user routes include profile management endpoints
- Confirmed avatar upload endpoint is correctly configured

## Current System Status ✅

### Backend (Port 3000)

- ✅ Authentication system (login, register, forgot password, reset password)
- ✅ User profile management (get, update profile, avatar upload)
- ✅ Email functionality (welcome emails, password reset emails)
- ✅ MongoDB connection and data persistence
- ✅ WebSocket support for real-time features
- ✅ File upload support for avatars

### Frontend (Port 5173)

- ✅ User registration and login pages
- ✅ Password reset functionality
- ✅ Profile settings with avatar upload
- ✅ Responsive design with modern UI
- ✅ Integration with backend APIs

### Database

- ✅ MongoDB running on localhost:27017
- ✅ User schema supports all required fields
- ✅ Password reset token system

## Configuration Required

### Email Setup (Important!)

To enable email functionality, users must:

1. **For Gmail (Recommended for development):**

   - Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
   - Generate an "App Password" for the application
   - Update the `.env` file with your Gmail credentials:
     ```env
     EMAIL_USER=your_gmail_email@gmail.com
     EMAIL_PASS=your_16_character_app_password
     SENDER_EMAIL=your_gmail_email@gmail.com
     ```

2. **For Other Email Providers:**
   - Update `EMAIL_HOST` and `EMAIL_PORT` accordingly
   - Ensure SMTP credentials are correct

### File Upload Directory

- ✅ Created `apps/backend/uploads/avatars/` directory
- ✅ Configured proper file permissions and validation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Authentication Flow:**

   - Test user registration with email verification
   - Test login functionality
   - Test password reset flow (requires email configuration)

2. **Profile Management:**

   - Test profile updates (name, bio, email)
   - Test avatar upload functionality
   - Verify data persistence

3. **System Integration:**
   - Test frontend-backend communication
   - Verify WebSocket connections work
   - Test file upload limits and validation

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

- Verify email credentials in `.env` file
- Check if Gmail App Password is correctly generated
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail account

### Avatar Upload Fails

- Check if `uploads/avatars` directory exists
- Verify file size is under 5MB
- Ensure file is a valid image format

### Port Conflicts

- Backend: Port 3000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- Frontend: Port 5173 (configurable via VITE_PORT)
- MongoDB: Port 27017

## Next Steps

1. Configure email credentials for full functionality
2. Test all authentication and profile features
3. Consider implementing additional security measures for production
4. Set up proper error logging and monitoring
