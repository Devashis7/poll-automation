# Whisper Service Scalability Recommendations

## Current Architecture
- Single-process Python FastAPI service
- In-memory queues and session management
- Synchronous model inference with occasional slowdowns

## Enterprise-Scale Architecture

### 1. Microservices Decomposition
- **Audio Receiver Service**: Lightweight service that only receives audio and puts it in a message queue
- **Transcription Worker Pool**: Multiple worker instances that pull from the queue and process transcriptions
- **Results Aggregator**: Service that collects transcriptions and manages WebSocket broadcasts

### 2. Message Queue Integration
- Replace in-memory queues with Redis, RabbitMQ, or Kafka
- Enable multiple workers to process audio chunks in parallel
- Implement priority queues for real-time vs. batch processing

### 3. Horizontal Scaling
- Deploy multiple transcription workers behind a load balancer
- Auto-scale workers based on queue depth and CPU utilization
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration and automatic scaling

### 4. Model Optimization
- Quantize models to INT8 for faster inference
- Consider specialized hardware (NVIDIA T4/A10 GPUs)
- Explore model distillation for smaller, faster models

### 5. Stateless Design
- Move session state to Redis or a distributed cache
- Implement WebSocket connections through a gateway that maintains client connections
- Use consistent hashing for session routing

### 6. Performance Monitoring
- Add detailed metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Set up alerting for queue depth and processing latency
- Implement circuit breakers for degraded performance modes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Optimize Current Architecture
- Implement the async queue processing (current PR)
- Add monitoring and metrics
- Optimize model parameters

### Phase 2: Message Queue Integration
- Introduce Redis/RabbitMQ for audio chunk distribution
- Refactor to support multiple worker processes
- Implement stateless session management

### Phase 3: Horizontal Scaling
- Containerize with Docker
- Deploy on Kubernetes
- Implement auto-scaling

### Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations
- Explore specialized hardware
- Implement model serving with ONNX Runtime or TensorRT
- Consider hybrid approaches (keyword spotting + full transcription)
